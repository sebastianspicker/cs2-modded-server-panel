# Audit

This directory is reserved for **code and issue audit reports**.

- Place findings, audit reports, and consolidated problem lists here (e.g. `*.md`).
- Reports should include file paths, line references, severity, and descriptions.
- Do not commit temporary or tool-specific run artifacts; keep only final, reviewable documents.

No automated audit tool is wired in this repo; audits are run externally and results are stored here for tracking.
